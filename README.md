# Simulating-Zero-Coupon-Bond-Dynamics-Valuing-Rate-Caps
In this case study, we execute a curve model for risk-neutral dynamics of zero-coupon bonds, simulate the evolution of bond prices, and calculate various par rates. We further use the model to estimate the values of several caps on specific time-frame rates. The study also includes valuing a 5-year resettable cap and a 5-year CMS cap.
